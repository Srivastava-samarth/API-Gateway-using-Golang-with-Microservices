# API Gateway using Golang with Microservices

## Overview
This project implements an API Gateway using Go and the Fiber framework, integrating three microservices: Auth, Orders, and Payment. It ensures efficient routing, load balancing, and API management, facilitating seamless communication between clients and backend services. The API Gateway enhances scalability, security, and maintainability in a microservices architecture.

## Features

**Routing and Load Balancing**

- Efficiently routes incoming requests to the appropriate microservice based on predefined rules.

**API Management**

- Provides a centralized location to manage API traffic, monitor endpoints, and enforce policies.

**Security**

- Implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure communication between clients and microservices.

**Logging and Monitoring**

- Integrates logging and monitoring tools to track API usage, detect anomalies, and troubleshoot issues.

**Scalability**

- Enables seamless scaling of microservices independently without affecting client applications.

**Error Handling**

- Implements robust error handling strategies to ensure reliability and graceful degradation.

## Dependencies

**Backend**

- **Go**: Backend programming language.
- **Fiber**: Fast and efficient web framework for Go.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication between services.

**Development Tools**

- **Git**: Version control system.
- **VS Code**: Integrated development environment (IDE) for coding.
- **Postman**: API testing tool.

**Build and Deployment**

- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment (if applicable).
- **GitHub Actions**: Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.

## Development Status

This project is currently undergoing active development.
